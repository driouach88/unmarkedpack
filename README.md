Unmarked Police Pack Add-On

I’ve taken 5 different unmarked vehicles, and made them all into 1 pack for FiveM.


Installation Guide:
Download the unmarked-megapack.zip
Extract the unmarked-megapack resource into your resources folder.
Edit your server.cfg and add “start unmarked-megapack” in there.

Spawn codes:
um1 - 2015 Chevy Tahoe PPV
um2 - 2011 Ford Crown Victoria
um3 - 2015 Dodge Charger
um4 - 2012 Ford Taurus
um5 - 2014 FPIU


I do not claim credit for these vehicles, I just made them into an easily installable pack for FiveM. Original downloads here:
